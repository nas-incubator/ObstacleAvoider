This repository contains the code and setup instructions for a obstacle follower robot using an Arduino board. The bot is designed to avoid obstacles using two IR sensors and a set of motors.

*Hardware Setup
  Arduino Board: Used to control the bot.
  Motors: Four motor pins are connected to pins 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Arduino.
  IR Sensors: Two IR sensors are connected to pins 8 and 8 of the Arduino.

*Pin Configuration
  Motor Pins:
  Motor 1: Pin 1 (D1), Pin 2 (D2)
  Motor 2: Pin 3 (D3), Pin 4 (D4)
  IR Sensor Pins:
  IR Sensor 1: Pin 8
  IR Sensor 2: Pin 9

*Uploading the Code
  1. Connect your Arduino: Use the USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer.
  2. Select your board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board and select your Arduino board. Then, go to Tools > Port and select the correct port for your Arduino.
  3. Upload the code: Click the upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your Arduino board.
